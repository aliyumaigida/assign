      <h1>World-Wide Web News November 1992</h1>
      <p>
        (As usual, this is distributed in plain text form, but the original
        hypertext contains lots of links and may be read as
        http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/News/9211.html. If you don't have
        World-Wide Web software yet, telnet to info.cern.ch (128.141.201.74),
        and select information about the WorldWide Web.)
      </p>
      <h2>Client software</h2>
      <p>
        Three developments on the clients side. Tony Johnson of Boston
        University, developer of the <a href="MidasWWW">MidasWWW</a> browser for Motif, has ported it
        now to four X11 platforms and has a tar file of sources available on
        ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src or
        ftp://freehep.scri.fsu.edu/freehep/networking_news_email/midaswww as
        midaswww_1.0.tar.Z Tony also has plans to include graphics and text
        editing in the future. Here at CERN, Nicola Pellow is back until the end
        of the year, and has picked up the <a href="Mac Browser">Mac Browser</a> . She has a pre-alpha
        with basic functionality up, watch this space for the first release. The
        full-screen client (using curses) has been released by Jim Whitescarver
        of NJIT, see <a href="release note">release note</a> for details. The NeXTStep client has been
        revised. The 0.13 version generated bad SGML at times, so anyone using
        it to write hypertext is advised to upgrade to 0.14 immediately. The
        binary is in
        ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/next/WorldWideWeb_0.14.app.tar.Z
      </p>
      <h2>More and more hypertext on line</h2>
      <p>
        New W3 servers have appeared at <a href="KVI">KVI</a> ad at <a href="CWI">CWI</a> both in the Netherlands,
        IN2P3 in France, and <a href="NCSA">NCSA</a> in Illinois, USA. KVI and <a href="IN2P3">IN2P3</a> are both High
        Energy Physics institites. All the servers have local information as
        well as various other goodies. CWI has a hypertext version of the Gnu
        documentation and of a guide to <a href="Audio formats">Audio formats</a>  , and NCSA has many things
        including hypertext documentation for the <a href="X-Collage">X-Collage</a> system. Two CERN
        projects to produce online hypertext documentation recently are ADAMO
        and <a href="RD13">RD13</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="Cornell Law school">Cornell Law school</a> have a server with hypertext of
        US Copyright Law... as law tends to be mostly cross-reference ("as
        defined in Sect1.2.2.(a) above") hypertext makes a lot of sense here!

      <h2>Browse the WAIS servers</h2>
      <p>
        It's sometimes been a bit difficult browsing through what there is in
        the WAIS world. Now, looking for information under "types of server" on
        the web will lead you to hypertext lists of WAIS servers arranged by
        name of "source" and by internet domain. These lists are generated
        automatically at CERN from TMC's catalogue. Clicking on the source name
        takes you directly to the index. Currently there are 310 databases on 88
        hosts accesible. (Previous issue was <a href="September 1992">September 1992</a> )
